### React query (TanStack query) ✨

React query was used to make data patching, caching, synchronous, <br/>
and updating the status of the server easier within the React application.

### React custom hooks ✨

Custom hooks were used to separate the UI code from the code containing business logic, <br/>
and react queries and query mutations using the same key were made into one custom hook, making it easy to maintain, clean, scalable, and easy to test.

### React Router ✨

React Router was used to show multiple pages in the Single Page Application, <br/>
aditionally, it was used to distinguish between users with Admin privileges and regular users. <br/>
This website, the Admin account shows an icon that goes to a page where you can upload a product, and this page is prevented accessing regular users.

## PostCSS

Using PostCSS, which modularized the CSS, each component was more independent and reusable.

## Firebase

The product information can be uploaded and imported using the Real-time database and store and load user-generated reviews or user-cart information in real-time. Using the Firebase Auth API, it is implemented to log in with an email and Google account, and the information of the logged-in user and the login and logout functions can use and read in all components using the useContext Hook.
