# Core skills for this project
</br>

## React query (TanStack query)
React query was used to make data patching, caching, synchronous, <br/>
and updating the status of the server easier within the React application.

## React custom hooks ✨
Custom hooks were used to separate the UI code from the code containing business logic, <br/>
and react queries and query mutations using the same key were made into one custom hook, making it easy to maintain, clean, scalable, and easy to test.

## React Router ✨
React Router was used to show multiple pages in the Single Page Application, <br/>
aditionally, it was used to distinguish between users with Admin privileges and regular users. <br/>
This website, the Admin account shows an icon that goes to a page where you can upload a product, and this page is prevented accessing regular users.
